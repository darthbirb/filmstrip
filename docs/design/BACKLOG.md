# Design backlog

What the next Claude Design pass should draw. Each entry is one issue and the fix recommended
for it; once the fix is drawn and built, the entry is deleted. An entry marked **DRAWN** has
been through a pass already and is waiting to be built, so it does not need drawing again.

An entry marked **DEFECT** is a fault in what a pass drew — a contradiction between two sheets, a
drawing that disagrees with what is already built, or a state that was never drawn at all. Defects
are drawn before anything else and nothing is built from a sheet that carries one: a surface built
from an incomplete drawing is built twice.

"The old drawing" is `ggallery-drawing.html` in this folder. Where an entry borrows from it,
take its structure and behaviour, and fit its values to the current token sheet: Plex, Phosphor,
the red focus ring, the white in-pane mark.

Always update the existing sheets in place. A new drawing belongs on the sheet its subject
already lives on, never in a file of its own.

## Scrubbing a video's tile · DRAWN

A video's tile shows one frame. In ggallery, running the pointer across a video's tile scrubbed
through it, left to right.

Moving the pointer across a video's tile shows the frame at that point in the clip. Draw what
shows while it scrubs, a thin position line along the tile's foot and the time under the pointer
in the length plate, and what a video with no scrub frames shows, since they need ffmpeg.

## A scrubber for the grid · DRAWN

A large folder scrolls with a thin scrollbar, and reaching the middle of forty thousand pictures
is slow.

Consider the old drawing's scrubber: a 16px channel at the grid's edge with a square thumb, held
to jump anywhere; the position is the information. Investigate whether it replaces the
scrollbar or sits beside it. The pass that drew it recommends building the other ten first, and
only building this if the largest folders still feel unnavigable afterwards.

## Library counts · DRAWN

The foot counts items and sources, and nothing says how much the library weighs, what kind it
is, or what waits and what is thrown away (#59).

Drawn on Artboards › Library counts: the foot's baseline becomes the items and their size, and
a click on it opens the totals above it in the menu's shape, a row each for pictures, videos,
in all, the Sorting Box and the Trash, then the sources, with any that is away named and
counted from the index. Drawn at rest, under the pointer, focused, open, folded, with a source
away, while a walk runs, with one item, empty and at the panel's least; the Sorting Box's
header names a sorting source that is away.
